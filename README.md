# StreamDeck JSON Sender
Plugin for Elgato Streamdeck to send JSON to a Server. 

Sends a user defined JSON Object to any specified address. You can change IP,Port,Method(GET, POST) and even specify HTTP-Header info to match your needs.

The advantage of this vs. using the "open file" plugin provided by StreamDeck is that your current main window does not change, thus allowing you to trigger actions while e.g. gaming in fullscreen mode.
